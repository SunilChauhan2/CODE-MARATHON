# 🏃‍♂️ 30-Day Code Marathon

This repository contains my solutions for a **30-day coding marathon challenge**, where I solved one problem each day to improve my problem-solving and C++ programming skills.

---

## 📌 What is this?

During the marathon I worked on daily coding problems in **C++**, covering various topics such as:

- Functions and loops  
- Data structures basics  
- Conditionals and logic  
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Problem decomposition

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- **C++** (all solutions)  
- Git/GitHub for version control  

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

Each file corresponds to a day’s solution:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DAY_1.cpp` | Problem for Day 1 |
| `DAY2.cpp` | Problem for Day 2 |
| … | … |
| `DAY29.CPP` | Problem for Day 29 |
| `DAY30.cpp` | Problem for Day 30 |

*(You can later add short descriptions next to each file.)*

## 🧠 Why I Did It

This marathon helped me:

- Practice consistent coding habit  
- Improve my C++ syntax skills  
- Think algorithmically and debug faster  
- Build confidence solving varied problems

---

## 📦 How to Use

To run any solution locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunilChauhan2/CODE-MARATHON.git
```

2. Compile & run a file:

```bash
g++ DAY1.cpp -o DAY1
./DAY1
```

Or use any C++ IDE you prefer.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add problem descriptions
- Add test case input/output examples
- Refactor solutions for clarity
- Add CMake or build script
